This is a little project of a webiste for a DayZ server, its actually a copy from the original web-site, im trying to make it look better+work better on diferent devices, will be working on it until is done.
I really like this youtuber/game so for me it is just for fun, and learning, there is a lot for learning and this is not a finished project, will aways be working on it untill is done, a little by little we get there.

Is important to remember that i m also learning html/css + JS too, i mean i m basically a beginner so it is very simple stuff
